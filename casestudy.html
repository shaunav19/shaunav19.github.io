     <h2>Totshop</h2>
<button type="button">View Prototype</button>
      <h3>Project Overview</h3>
       <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>
        <p>User seemed to have an issue with there not being enough information
          on the item such as fabric or size information.They also had issues
          with the return process being too complicated and frequent spam
          emails.</p>
       <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
        <p>I found that by putting everything at face value makes it easier for
           people to find the categories they need. The return process is easier
           and every package sent out has a return label in it to make a easy
           return. There will also be a unsubscribe button on the account
           settings or the users who don't want frequent emails. Also to tackle
           the product information problem ,there is an “Information” button
           where they can find more information about the product.
</p>
       <h4>TOOLS USED</h4>
        <p>Balsamiq (Lo Fi Wirefirames) , Sketch( Hi Fi Wireframes) , Adobe
          Illustrator (User Personas) , Invision (Prototype)</p>
      <h3>Discovery</h3>
       <h4>User Research</h4>
        <p>The demographics of the users I got were females ,with no children,
          between the ages of 26-35. They liked the convenience of shopping
          online because they could do it anytime whether it be from work or
          from home. They used both mobile and pc/laptops. That tells me that
          the website of course has to work on both mobile and web platforms.
          Most people also did not use social media to register for a site so
          just using an email address and password may suffice when it comes to
          the registration process. Lastly, the users frustrations were that
          they did not like the hassles of returning on item especially via
          snail mail because it takes to long to get the exchange back or
          return credit. That tells me that I must have expedited prepaid return
          labels sent in their order to create a easy hassle free return
          process. Another frustration was that they received frequent spam
          emails so I need to make sure Totshop has an option where they can
          turn off the emails or adjust the frequency of the time the emails
          are being sent out.</p>
       <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
        <p>The competitors for Totshop are: OshKosh B’Gosh, Old Navy and Nike.
          What I noticed  was that a lot of those site looked really busy with
          a lot of graphics, which kind of makes your eyes go everywhere.
          Another thing I noticed was that some of the sites had no instant
          codes to receive a discount without signing up. So Totshop definitely
          needs a simple but fun site and instant codes to receive an immediate
          discount.</p>
      <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>I had 3  user personas  and the common goals they all had was to be
          able to narrow down categories , to have a better membership program
          and to be able to see the reviews and ratings for each product. The
          common frustrations they all had were not being able to checkout as
          guest, shipping is not fast enough ,return process is a hassle and
          receiving email spam.</p>
      <h3>Information Architechture</h3>
       <h4>USER STORIES</h4>
        <p>The user stories I thought of set me up for what the users would
          actually need vs what would be just nice to have . Overall the MUST
          HAVES are being able to check out as a guest, being able to register
           with just an email address/password , see item reviews and ratings,
           and being able to see the item description. The things that were not
           necessarily needed at this stage were the little things that a user
           may want to do depending on the users purpose of the product. Those
           things were to be able to favorite an item as well as view all the
           favorited items, and being able to share those items via social media
           or email.</p>
       <h4>USER FLOWS</h4>
        <p>The user flows diagram showed how the user would sign up , or
           returning user would sign-in. As well as navigating the homepage as a
           new or returning user.  For instance a new user would hit the sign up
           button on the pop up modal ,then be directed to sign up with a email
           and , after that they would be given a code that they can use
           instantly.</p>
      <h3>Branding</h3>
        <p>When it came to branding I wanted that was playful so i thought of
          the Fisher- Price Rock-A-Stack toy. The initial logos above showed the
          toy above but I rounded the edges. The color scheme I chose are light
          and peaceful which is what most parents want when there doing their
          online shopping. I also did the moodboard to give me diffrent ideas
          about the different styles that are out there. The typefaces are what
          im most proud of , the font Fredericka the Great reminded me of the
          type of font that one would see in a childrens storybook. Im proud of
          the entire branding process , makes me happy the choices I made , made
          a beautiful prototype.</p>
      <h3>Wireframes</h3>
       <h4>Lo Fi Wireframes</h4>
          <p>My low fidelity wireframes was a basic  wireframe made with
            balsamiq which showed a nice spaced out easy to read homepage. I was
            also playing around with color schemes at this time.</p>
      <h3>User Testing + Mockups</h3>
       <h4> USER TESTING</h4>
         <p>I did my user testing from 3 different sources : two online 5 minute
            user test and an in person user test from a 30yo male who works in
            transportation. The first online user tester stated she liked the
            color scheme of the website and stated that the website looked done.
            The second user tester really liked the layout and color scheme of
            the website and immediately knew what kind of website it was. He
            stated that the initial sign up modal had too much white space and
            either needed to be made smaller or to add in some content into the
            modal to fill up some more space. The 3rd user tester was an in
            person test, the user immediately knew where to click to add to cart
            or to sign up. He liked the simplicity of the website and stated
            “everything was where it needed to be” , in addition he also liked
            how there was a discount code to entice him to purchase an item even
            if he didn't originally intend too. I take way that with a few
            tweaks and modifications ,Totshop is a great project and website.</p>
       <h4>MOCKUPS</h4>
         <p>My high fidelity wireframe had the fonts that I choose added in
            which were Amatic SC for the headings and Raleway for the paragraphs
            and other fonts. This hi fi wireframe also had more detail listed
            like product information. As well as the color scheme that was
            chosen. The images I choose were based of a more classy and polished
            look. I wanted Totshop to look playful but classy at the same time,
            hence the more simplistic look and the bold imagery.</p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
       <h4>FINAL THOUGHTS...</h4>
         <p>In conclusion, what ended of working was the simplicity of the
           website. Good spacing and easy to read font is what had the website
           come together. Initially, the color scheme was a little bit of a
           problem, because trying to figure out to make a website playful but
           also professional is a little hard . I made a mood board which helped
           tremendously and I'm happy with how my website turned out. I was
           concerned in the beginning because I was not sure if I would come up
           with a color scheme or font that would match the look I was trying to
           go for. Im happy with all the time and effort I have put into
           Totshop.</p>
