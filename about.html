     <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>Im a Virginia native that has recently moved to the sacramento area.
        Im a major foodie who loves the small things in life whether that be
        just walking outside or reading about something new.  When im not
        spending time with my family, you can usually find me at the gym or
        hanging out with my friends.</p>
     <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>Being in the customer service industry for almost 10 years, I have.
        become an expert at problem solving and being able to read people.
         Although I do still love customer service , I decided it was time for
         a career change to be apart of something bigger .Thus comes UX design
         and front end developlment skiils. just being able to learn these
         skills has greatly improved my respect for the tech industry.
         Through my mentorship program I was able to grasp the basic skills
         to be able to have my users interact effortlessly through my website.
         Im so confident and proud of how far I have come and I know that the
         learning has just begun and im welcoming it all.</p>
      <h3>Design Process</h3>
       <p>I usually start by putting myself in the shoes of the users that will
          be using he website or the product. We have to realize we are all
          different humans and the way we interact are different, While User
          research and Information architecure are my main strengths. Im also
          cross-disciplined in interactIon and user flow design, user research
          interview ,content strategy and front end development. I also like to
          make sure I test design a few times  at different points through out
          the process to make sure I am on the right track. </p>
